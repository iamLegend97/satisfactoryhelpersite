__Currently not supported future plans:__
- Specific building overclocking/downclocking. **_(In progress)_**
- Changing item/building ratios. This is relevant if you're interesting power efficiency. For example achieving 30 ingots/min can be achieved with 1 or 2 (or more) machines, with each added machine improving power efficiency, but this was too much to do for the time being.
- Related to the last point: setting an overall clock on a machine type.
- Alternative recipe options from HDD's
- Adding materials after tier 3
- Tree which shows heirarachy of buildings and where all their outputs go
