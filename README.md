# Satisfactory Helper DISCONTINUED DUE TO REDUNDANCY
## A helper for Satisfactory calculations - A game by Coffee Stain Studios
https://kylerhenry.github.io/satisfactoryhelpersite/

__Currently supported:__
- Output rate specification
  - Gives input rates needed of all items to make that happen
  - Gives power consumption and number of buildings
  - Calculates based on a last-machine-underclock format ie. For weird numbers of outputs, the program calculates the number of 100%     machines needed, plus a last machine which is under-clocked to match the weird rate. This is factored into power consumption.

__Currently not supported future plans:__
- Specific building overclocking/downclocking. **_(In progress)_**
- Changing item/building ratios. This is relevant if you're interesting power efficiency. For example achieving 30 ingots/min can be achieved with 1 or 2 (or more) machines, with each added machine improving power efficiency, but this was too much to do for the time being.
- Related to the last point: setting an overall clock on a machine type.
- Alternative recipe options from HDD's **_(In progress)_**
- Adding materials after tier 3
- Tree which shows heirarachy of buildings and where all their outputs go
